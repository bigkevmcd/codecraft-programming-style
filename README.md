# CodeCraft - Exercises in Programming Style

This is a repository of starter code for CodeCraft's "Exercises in Programming Style" session.

This is based on Cristina Videira Lopes' great book ["Exercises in Programming Style"](https://www.crcpress.com/Exercises-in-Programming-Style/Lopes/p/book/9781482227376).

# The Problem Statement

* Counts the occurrences of words (term frequencies) in a file
* Reads input words from a file `pride-and-prejudice.txt`
* Removes all non-alphanumeric characters
* Normalise (down-cases) the words
* Removes stop words (“the”, “a”, “for” etc.) see `stop_words.txt`
* Counts the occurrences of all words
* Prints out the 25 most common words in order.
